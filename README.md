## Why is it

Writing the word "Á¶è" (Fu) is the tradition of Chinese New Year, people will write a big "Á¶è" on red paper and stick it on the door to express the good expectations of the new year.

This is a great example that shows the common way people communicating with colors: **using colors to express feelings or ideas**.

- What if we can get can colors by words? ([@colorfu/color](./packages/color/README.md))
- What if we can mix colors to patterns? ([@colorfu/pattern](./packages/pattern/README.md))
- What if we can select colors more efficiently? ([@colorfu/vue-color-picker](./packages/vue-color-picker/README.md), [@colorfu/react-color-picker](./packages/react-color-picker/README.md))
- What if we can use more colors and more words to make wallpapers to express more feelings? ([@colorfu/playround](./packages/playground/README.md))

We can definitely comminute better with colors and have a more colorful life.
