## Why is it

Writing the word "福" (Fu) is the tradition of Chinese New Year, people will write a big "福" on red paper and stick it on the door to express the good expectations of the new year.

This is a great example that people use words and colors to express their feelings or ideas. And on the other hand, wallpaper is the most common thing we see everyday which should not be cold.

What it if you can use more colors and more words to make wallpapers to express more feelings ? In that way, not only can you make your wallpapers beautiful, but also make them meaningful.
