Writing the word \"福\" (Fu) is the tradition of Chinese New Year, people will write a big\n          \"福\" on red paper and stick it on the door to express the good expectations of the new\n          year.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This is a great example that people use words and colors to express their feelings or\n          ideas. And on the other hand, wallpaper is the most common thing we see everyday which\n          should not be cold.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          What it if you can use more colors and more words to make wallpapers to express more\n          feelings ? In that way, not only can you make your wallpapers beautiful, but also make\n          them meaningful.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          There are some colors, patterns and words provided by ColorFu, and you can even extract colors from\n          an image. Find the stories behind them and use them to make your own stories.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <el-select v-model=\"selectedValue\">\n            <el-option\n              v-for=\"item in
